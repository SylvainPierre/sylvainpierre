# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sylvain

I left France for Vietnam in 2006 to co-found [Officience](https://officience.com/), a French BPO company, with two other associates. After growing the company to 300 people, we decided to change our management model in 2014 to embrace a flatter and more open structure, a move about which I gave a [TED talk in 2015 in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmmhzljJdw).

In 2016, I moved to Japan to launch [Le Wagon's Tokyo franchise](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo). Le Wagon is a coding bootcamp for entrepreneur and creative people. In 7 years, we grew our local community to over 9,000 members, expanded to Kyoto in October 2018, launched a new Data Science program, and **have trained 1,000 aspiring developers and entrepreneurs**.

I am a business books and TED enthusiast, fan of Seth Godin, Clay Shirky and FrÃ©dÃ©ric Laloux's ideas. Curious about the latest business and social trends, I regularly share my own opinions on innovation, globalization and organizational innovation on my blog and twitter.

Funny anecdote about me: I got portrayed in a French comic book talking about organizational innovation.
